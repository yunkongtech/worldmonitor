Open source intelligence used to require a dozen subscriptions, custom scrapers, and years of domain expertise. A professional OSINT analyst's browser might have 50+ tabs open at any given time: flight trackers, ship trackers, earthquake monitors, conflict databases, Telegram channels, RSS readers, and satellite imagery viewers.

World Monitor collapses that entire workflow into a single interactive dashboard.

## The Tab Sprawl Problem

If you've ever tried to monitor a developing situation, whether it's a military escalation, a natural disaster, or a supply chain disruption, you know the drill:

1. Open FlightRadar24 for aircraft movements
2. Open MarineTraffic for ship positions
3. Open USGS for earthquake data
4. Open ACLED for conflict events
5. Open Liveuamap for real-time mapping
6. Open Reuters, AP, and Al Jazeera for news
7. Open Telegram for raw OSINT channels
8. Open Polymarket for prediction markets
9. Open gpsjam.org for GPS interference
10. Open NASA FIRMS for fire detection

Each tool has its own interface, its own refresh cycle, its own learning curve. Cross-referencing between them is manual and slow. By the time you've built a picture, the situation has moved.

World Monitor integrates all of these data sources (and many more) into a single, layered map with real-time updates. Learn more about [what World Monitor is and how it works](/blog/posts/what-is-worldmonitor-real-time-global-intelligence/).

## 435+ Intelligence Feeds, Zero Configuration

World Monitor aggregates **435+ RSS feeds** organized across 15 categories:

- Geopolitics and defense
- Middle East and North Africa
- Africa and Sub-Saharan
- Think tanks and policy institutes
- Technology and AI
- Finance and markets
- Energy and commodities
- Cybersecurity

Each feed is classified by a **4-tier credibility system**, so you always know whether you're reading a primary source or secondary analysis. Server-side aggregation reduces API calls by 95%, and per-feed circuit breakers ensure one broken source doesn't take down the dashboard.

## Live Tracking: Ships, Planes, and Signals

Three of World Monitor's most powerful layers bring live tracking to your screen:

### ADS-B Aircraft Tracking

Military and civilian aircraft positions update in real time via OpenSky and Wingbits enrichment. The system automatically identifies military aircraft and displays their callsigns, types, and flight paths on the map.

### AIS Maritime Monitoring

Ship positions from AISStream.io are merged with **USNI Fleet Reports**, giving you both transponder data and editorial context from the U.S. Naval Institute. This combination reveals the complete order-of-battle for major naval deployments, something that usually requires a classified briefing.

### GPS/GNSS Jamming Detection

ADS-B anomaly data is processed through an H3 hexagonal grid to identify zones where GPS signals are being jammed or spoofed. This is a critical indicator of electronic warfare activity, and World Monitor maps it automatically.

## 26 Telegram OSINT Channels

World Monitor integrates **26 curated Telegram channels** via MTProto, organized by reliability tier:

- **Tier 1:** Verified primary sources
- **Tier 2:** Established OSINT accounts (Aurora Intel, BNO News, DeepState, OSINT Defender, LiveUAMap)
- **Tier 3:** Secondary aggregators (Bellingcat, NEXTA, War Monitor)

These channels often break news 15-30 minutes before traditional media. Having them integrated alongside verified feeds gives you both speed and context.

## AI-Powered Threat Classification

Raw intelligence is only useful if you can process it. World Monitor runs a **3-stage threat classification pipeline**:

1. **Keyword matching** for immediate categorization
2. **Browser-based ML** (Transformers.js running in Web Workers) for sentiment and entity extraction
3. **LLM classification** for nuanced threat assessment

This runs locally in your browser. No data leaves your machine unless you explicitly choose a cloud LLM provider.

## The Country Instability Index

One of World Monitor's original contributions to OSINT is the **Country Instability Index (CII)**, a real-time 0-100 score computed for every monitored nation:

- **Baseline risk (40%):** Historical conflict data, governance indicators
- **Unrest indicators (20%):** Protests, strikes, civil disorder events
- **Security events (20%):** Military activity, terrorism, border incidents
- **Information velocity (20%):** News volume spikes that indicate developing situations

The CII is boosted by real-time signals: proximity to active hotspots, OREF rocket alerts, GPS jamming activity, and travel advisory changes. The result is a heatmap overlay that shows, at a glance, where instability is rising.

## Hotspot Escalation Scoring

World Monitor doesn't just show you where things are happening. It tells you where they're getting worse. The **Hotspot Escalation Score** combines:

- News activity (35%)
- CII score (25%)
- Geographic convergence (25%): when 3+ event types co-occur within the same 1-degree grid cell in 24 hours
- Military indicators (15%)

When a region's escalation score spikes, it surfaces in the Strategic Risk panel before traditional media picks up the story.

## Sharing Intelligence

Found something significant? World Monitor's story sharing lets you export intelligence briefs to Twitter/X, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Reddit, complete with auto-generated Open Graph images for social previews.

You can also share map states via URL: the map position, active layers, time range, and selected data points are all encoded in a shareable link. Send a colleague a URL and they see exactly what you see.

## Getting Started with World Monitor for OSINT

1. **Open worldmonitor.app** in any modern browser
2. **Toggle layers** using the left sidebar: start with "Conflicts" and "Military Bases"
3. **Click any data point** on the map for details and source links
4. **Open the [Command Palette](/blog/posts/command-palette-search-everything-instantly/)** (Cmd+K / Ctrl+K) to fuzzy-search across 24 result types and 250+ country commands
5. **Click any country** for its full intelligence dossier with CII score
6. **Set up keyword monitors** for topics you want to track persistently

No account needed. No API keys required for the web version. For local AI analysis, install Ollama and point World Monitor at your local instance. You can also explore [AI-powered intelligence without the cloud](/blog/posts/ai-powered-intelligence-without-the-cloud/).

## Why Open Source Matters for OSINT

Closed-source intelligence tools are black boxes. You can't verify how they score threats, where their data comes from, or whether their algorithms have blind spots.

World Monitor's AGPL-3.0 license means every scoring algorithm, every data pipeline, and every AI prompt is open for inspection. Security researchers can audit it. Academics can cite it. Developers can extend it. And anyone can self-host it for complete operational security.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is World Monitor really free for OSINT research?**
Yes. Every feature, data source, and AI capability is available at no cost with no account required. The platform is open source under AGPL-3.0, so you can also self-host it.

**Do I need technical skills to use World Monitor for OSINT?**
No. The interface is designed for analysts of all skill levels. Toggle layers on the sidebar, click data points for details, and use the Command Palette (Cmd+K) to search across all intelligence sources instantly.

**How does World Monitor compare to traditional OSINT tools?**
World Monitor consolidates 435+ feeds, live tracking, AI analysis, and 45 data layers into one dashboard. Traditional tools require juggling dozens of separate platforms. See our [detailed comparison with traditional intelligence tools](/blog/posts/worldmonitor-vs-traditional-intelligence-tools/).
