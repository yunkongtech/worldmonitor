Most intelligence platforms force you into a single vertical. A financial terminal. A cybersecurity feed. A conflict tracker. If your work spans multiple domains, you're left juggling subscriptions.

## Shared Capabilities Across All Variants

Regardless of which variant you use, you get the full platform engine:

### Interactive 3D Globe + Flat Map

Dual map engines (globe.gl/Three.js for 3D, deck.gl for flat WebGL) that switch at runtime. Both support all 45 data layers.

### AI Analysis

The 4-tier LLM fallback chain (Ollama, Groq, OpenRouter, browser T5) works across all variants. Generate briefs, classify threats, and run analysis privately.

### 21 Languages

Full internationalization with lazy-loaded language packs, locale-specific RSS feeds, and RTL support for Arabic.

### Command Palette (Cmd+K)

Fuzzy search across 24 result types and 250+ country commands. Find anything instantly.

### 8 Regional Presets

Jump between Global, Americas, Europe, MENA, Asia, Africa, Oceania, and Latin America views.

### URL State Sharing

Every view state (map position, active layers, selected panels, time range) is encoded in a shareable URL.

### Story Sharing

Export intelligence briefs to Twitter/X, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Reddit with auto-generated Open Graph preview images.

### Desktop App

The Tauri app for macOS, Windows, and Linux works with all variants, with OS keychain storage and offline capabilities.

### Progressive Web App

Install on any device from the browser. Includes offline map caching (500 tiles).

## Switching Between Variants

In the web app, switch variants via the header navigation. Your preferences, language settings, and AI configuration carry across variants.

The variants share a single codebase. Every improvement to the core engine benefits all five dashboards simultaneously. A map performance optimization for World Monitor automatically makes Commodity Monitor faster too.

## Why Five Variants Instead of One?

**Signal-to-noise ratio.**

An OSINT analyst tracking the Taiwan Strait doesn't need stablecoin peg data cluttering their sidebar. A commodity trader monitoring copper prices doesn't need Telegram OSINT channels distracting their view.

Each variant curates the information that matters for its audience. The panels are pre-selected. The layers are prioritized. The news feeds are filtered. You get a dashboard that feels purpose-built for your work, without the cognitive load of configuring a general-purpose tool.

But when you need to cross domains (the commodity trader wants to check if a conflict is affecting mining operations), switching to World Monitor is one click away.

## One Platform, Zero Cost

All five variants are completely free. No freemium gates. No "contact sales" buttons. No feature tiers. The same platform, the same data, the same AI. Available to a solo researcher in Nairobi and a hedge fund analyst in New York.

Open source under AGPL-3.0. Deploy it yourself, contribute to it, or just use it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I use multiple dashboard variants at the same time?**
Yes. Each variant runs at its own URL, so you can open several in separate browser tabs. Your preferences and language settings carry across all of them.

**Do the variants share the same data, or are they separate platforms?**
All five variants share a single codebase and the same underlying data engine. The difference is which panels, layers, and feeds are pre-selected for each audience.

**Is there a limit on how long I can use the dashboards for free?**
No. All five variants are completely free with no time limits, feature gates, or usage caps.
